<p style="font-size:200%"> What do <strong> YOU </strong> think we should do? 
When should we start making the actual scheduling app? Should we do it.. </p>
<form>
<input type="radio" name="When" value="ASAP">-As soon as possible, I'm ready! <br>
<input type="radio" name="when" value="Soon">-Pretty soon, but give me a few days. <br>
<input type="radio" name="when" value="Sometime">-Soon, but maybe we should wait a while.
At least until we've learned Python. <br>
<input type="radio" name="when" value="Later">-Let's wait until December, at least. 
Have to get there eventually, but we'll get around to it later. <br>
<input type="radio" name="when" value="never">-You know what, let's just not make the app at all.
</form>
<p> Just thought I'd ask. Leave your answer under this line (separate it with a br!).</p>
