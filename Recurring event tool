        <p>  <b> Welcome to the <span> RECURRING EVENTS TOOL </span>!  
        This is a tool designed for scheduling recurring events in an in-depth way.  
        You can set the date of an event, be it a day of the week or of the month!  
        You can also highlight days, weeks, or months in which an event will <i> not </i>occur!  
        All this, you can do with the <span> RECURRING EVENTS TOOL </span> </b>! </p>
        <h5> (At least, you can once it's complete.) </h5>
        
<!-- Now for the calendar! -->
