<h1>
The <strong> NEWEST </strong> and the <strong> BEST </strong> in the app business! </h1>
<p style="font-size: 500%"> PROJECT DRAGOONFLEE! </p>
<p> Well, we won't call it that eventually. It's tentative. 
But look out for an app that <i> was </i> called PROJECT DRAGOONFLEE! </p>
<h2> The latest in scheduling apps! </h2>
<p> ... </p>
<h5> Dang it, I think someone else put one up.. </h5>
<p> ANYWAYS, this app allows you to create a chart! With chains of events! <br>
SEPARATE CHAINS OF EVENTS! I leave you all in awe. </p>
<p> Yes, you can match up schedules and coordinate. 
So if Bob needs to talk to Joe, you can see if Schedule <sup> Bob </sup> matches Schedule <sup> Joe </sup> in a minute! </p>
<h3> Will you have to manually input every event? Or will this app use your phone calendars and sync them up? </h3>
<p> Depends on if anybody <b> actually uses their phone calendars! </b> </p>
<p> But never theless, PROJECT DRAGOONFLEE, or whatever it ends up being, will be great! </p>
<blockquote>
I once used PROJECT DRAGOONFLEE. Then I realized it didn't exist. 
Now I wonder what I was on to make me think I used PROJECT DRAGOONFLEE. <br> --That drunk guy across the street
